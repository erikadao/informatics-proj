    <h4> Return to NeuralNudge </h4>
  </a>



  <h1 style="text-align: center;"> Welcome</h1>
  <p style="text-align: center;">We are NeuralNudge, a group of college students who have shared a similar journey where stress and anxiety became much more than an academic challenge. Our story begins with a group of passionate minds who have navigated a demanding and highly stressful higher education. As college students, we found ourselves deeply impacted by the toll our mental well-being took. We firsthand experienced sleepless nights, tremendous amounts of pressure, and the struggle to maintain a healthy balance between our personal and academic life. 

  Experiencing similar issues, we decided to create a technological innovation that resonated with us. Our mission is to raise awareness, provide resources, and create a community where mental health is taken into consideration. We understand individuals have a personal and unique mental health journey, through our device we aim to lend a helping hand and create resources to help make their journey a little easier.
